Two options,Anyone is welcome.
1. Re-do the neural network and BP algorithm in 'ex4.pdf'and test the MNIST image data.
2. Re-do the neural network model proposed in the following paper,
Hinton, G. E. and Salakhutdinov, R. R. (2006)
Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks.
Science, Vol. 313. no. 5786, pp. 504 - 507, 28 July 2006.
The PDF paper and codes can be downloaded from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/MatlabForSciencePaper.html.

Try to present the model, the algorithm, the MNIST dataset, and the results in details. Then submit to my email before next friday.
